Yes another court case took place on Torrent SMP. The players Nout11 and Oerfi engaged in a conversation that quickly turned inflammatory. Oerfi referred to Nout11 as a mispelling of his name that could be interpreted as graphic. This led to a full-scale indendiary conversation that quickly led to moderators getting involved. During this time, Oerfi asked a moderator a bigoted question, but was drowned out by Nout11 dragging the conversation even further into the territory of toxicity. In response, the moderator ZephyrZymbol muted Nout11 on Discord, where he was communicating from with our Discord -> Minecraft integration. Nout11 then continued to drag out the conversation in-game.

This led to a mute in-game and thus, a ticket in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/torrent). Nout11 had requested a court hearing as an appeal. Hilarity ensued. After a chaotic miscommunication about where and when the proceeding would take place, court was in session! As always, players screamed in chat asking for help getting to the courthouse. We hit a new record for the attendance of this session, 16 players in one room! Michael, the Divine Pig of Justice, was of course present for this hearing.

Court began with the opening statements. For some reason, OcularFool68 ended up being the plaintiff, even though he wasn't the one who muted Nout11. ZephyrZymbol was in the pews, and was asked to come to the plaintiff's bench. In the opening statements, Ocular expressed how the conversation devolved after Nout11 was told to stop with the spam and inflammatory comments. Nout11, without a microphone, expressed how he felt manipulated by Oerfi into losing his cool since it was all Oerfi's fault. After a lot of back and forth, it was slowly revealed that the decision to mute Nout11 was meant to "separate" the players from the argument.

It seemed that Oerfi started the whole debate, with his comments twisting Nout11's name into something inappropriate and an incendiary comment hurled at a moderator. Furthermore, Nout11 conducted himself well during the course of the case. However, a lack of accountability was observed. The prosecutor(s) asked the court for time served. Many more shenanigans took place, including a player named CMDRJBuck sitting in the boat with Michael, the Divine Pig of Justice, and running over to the defendant to... "dance with the shift key." This player was held in comtempt of court and placed in jail for the remainder of the proceeding. Furthermore, the chaos of the court session was exacerbated by a bug with our chat plugin when a Minehut player joins the server; the chat is duplicated for everyone on the server. This will be fixed next week.

In the closing statements, the prosecutors again asked for time served and asked for some accountability from Nout11. They also recognized that Oerfi started this whole debacle. The jury, Bumble_Bean and Kishku7, went to the deliberation room. They came out a short time later with a verdict: guilty. They recommended a sentence of time served plus community service. The community service would involve Nout11 being forced to harvest all the crops in the community farm in Ax√©l Village and replanting them. Also, Nout11 was forced to apologize to the court and acknowledge his wrongdoing. Lastly, in a shocking turn of events, the jury recommended the mute then be applied to Oerfi for one hour. The judge agreed, and the gavel was swung. Nout11 would stay unmuted and be sentenced to community service.

After the court proceeding, the players were asked to bow to Michael, the Divine Pig of Justice, save for those with religious convictions. JerichoTorrent attempted to feed the pig some cooked porkchops, shocking everyone. Nout11 apologized to the court by typing at 12 WPM. Court was adjourned. Nout11 followed the judge out of the court room, along with 7 players stacked on top of a player's head. Nout11 harvested all the crops and replanted them, failing to address the clear square of carrots within the wheat field, leading to frustration from .HurricaneAlly22. Another court case was in the books. Stay tuned for the next session of the Torrent District Court!
