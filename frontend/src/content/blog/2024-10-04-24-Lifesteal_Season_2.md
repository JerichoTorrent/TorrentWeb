# New Season Coming Soon!  

I am happy to go over our current plans for Lifesteal Season 2! We have a ton of awesome ideas to flesh out, and would love to hear your input. Much of the content of this server will be based off of your suggestions and feedback. Whether you were a Lifesteal Season 1 player or not, please let us know how we can do better and make a quality server you want to play on. Please let us know your thoughts in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/torrent).

Lifesteal Season 1 was a blast, and we learned a ton from the experience of developing and hosting this server for thousands of players over the last few months. Special thanks to some of our top players:
- Lixery | Earned the legendary **God of War** rank by having the best kill/death ratio of the season!
- OcularFool68 | The most helpful and integral player on the server, holding it together and helping new players as a fantastic moderator.
- Vipertwo & Bumble_Bean | The best team that lasted the longest on the server.
- GlodGlodsonGG | Our first overpowered player on the server; racked up a ton of kills in the first week.
- TheHitmanHusky | The richest player on the server, with over $48 million in the bank. However, PsYcHo8185 is fast approaching with over $44 million.

While it was a fun season, we learned from a ton of mistakes we made along the way. As mentioned before, we had thousands of players join the server, but many of them left due to some glaring issues we cannot ignore further. First of all, custom bosses and lifesteal don't seem to mix very well. The map, while only having a 5,000 block radius, seemed to spread people out for various reasons. Fighting the bosses, looting the castles, and just having to travel far from spawn to get to an area where you can build separated people from the core gameplay loop: PvP. Moreover, the somewhat confusing spawn area was not the greatest first impression of the server. Something more custom and packed with content would have been a better introduction to the server. The custom enchants and unbalanced economy made our money inflate quickly, and some players lost any challenge when they could get millions of dollars from one day of playtime.

These issues have all been addressed in our plan for season 2. By moving away from RPG style content, and switching gears into focusing heavily on the PvP content and a tighter progression system, we hope to have a much higher quality experience next season.

## Wild West  

Lifesteal Season 2 will take place in the Old West of Torrent. As you may have gathered up to this point, Lifesteal Season 1 took place in the distant past, soon after the [Convergence](https://wiki.torrentsmp.com/lore/the-convergence). Season 2 will take place long after that, around 200 years before Torrent SMP. So, you can expect saloons, jails, gem mines, and the like, with a Western themed spawn taking place in a custom mesa biome. By working with talented builders, we hope to build a beautiful spawn for you all. This spawn will have a ton of cool content, some of which you know and love from Season 1. We will be adding new quests (daily, weekly, and custom storylines,) and many new mechanics to the game.

## Honor System  

Season 2 will feature an extremely unique mechanic known as the honor system. By typing `/report <player>`, you can notify the server of their good or bad deeds. If they're egregious or rule breaking, server staff will be able to view these reports via a webhook. Good deeds will grow a player's honor. A player can also earn honor points by selecting the "good" options while doing quests. Examples of good deeds are defending a player from an attack, helping a player in some way, or giving a player some items. Bad deeds include rule breaking, killing defenseless players, and selecting the "bad" options while doing quests. Depending on the honor points a player has, positive or negative, they will qualify for entry into one of two guilds.

## Bounty Overhaul  

Bounties work much the same as they did last season, save for a few added mechanics. Once weekly, the highest bounty on the server will become the target of a **manhunt**. This will grant all hunters a custom compass item, that always points to the player with the highest bounty. As always, the hunter who kills the player with the bounty on their head will win the bounty. Furthermore, a player with high honor can join the **Bounty Hunters Guild**. This guild allows players to sign up to be hunters and chase down bounties, giving them the compass item. The player with the bounty on their head will have no idea they are being actively hunted until they get swarmed by bounty hunters, just like in the Old West. However, a player with low enough honor can join the **Outlaws Guild**. This guild gives players an opportunity to earn money by killing a player trying to claim their bounty. By killing this player, not only does the bounty get wiped, but the outlaw gets a portion of the bounty. This system will allow players to roleplay as law-abiding citizens or outlaws, should they so choose.

Players can pick up bounties from the Sheriff NPC at spawn, where the bounty board is posted on the wall. The ultimate goal of the guilds is to create a web interface, as well as an in-game profile. Players can view these stats to see the honor points of any player on the server, as well as their bounty history, good or bad. Will you be a bounty hunter or an outlaw? Let us know!

## Updates  

Along with the new mechanics, we will have many updates to balance the economy and learn from the mistakes of Season 1 to make a higher quality server:
- No more elytras in `/shop` so they are more rare.
- Players can no longer silk touch spawners so they are more rare.
- New McMMO skills
- *Half* the custom enchants that we had in Season 1. So many of them were very overpowered and unbalanced, like Trench.
- New custom item crate, including tools from the SMP.
- KoTH will be right next to spawn, located at a crashed alien UFO. Slime will leak all around the spacecraft, and players will have a jump boost effect.
- More events, including some big server-wide events.
- No custom bosses. Fight other players instead.
- Supply drops at a random, broadcasted location every 3 hours.
- A much more balanced, fair economy.
- Pie ray exploit fixes.

The tentative date for the last day of Season 1 is October 30th, 2024, when we will have a hardcore anarchy day. All grief-prevention at spawn will be turned off, and Clockwork crate keys will be given to everyone every hour. You will have one life. Please contact us in `/discord` on what items/abilities/etc. we should bring over from Season 1 if there's anything you think we should keep or carry over. Thank you for playing on our amazing lifesteal server! I hope to see you on Lifesteal Season 2, starting on... drum roll please... Halloween, 2024 (October 31st.) *Spooky*.
