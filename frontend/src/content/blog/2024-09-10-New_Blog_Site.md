Hi everyone! I am pleased to present the new Torrent blog site. A little bit of background about this site:
This site was built with Jekyll, a static site generator written in ruby, using markup languages and serving
them to the public! Credit to [HyG](https://github.com/Gaohaoyang/gaohaoyang.github.io) for this template.
The site is hosted on Oracle Cloud and deployed with Nginx and Cloudflare. Lots of fun!

Sometimes I like to focus on adjacent tasks (like a new blog site) while there are a thousand tasks to do
on my server network, like finishing SkyFactions. I will likely use this site as a development journal.
The cool thing about this blog is you can leave comments! Simply create a Disquis account (it takes 10
seconds) and log in to my site. You can leave comments, reactions, and reply to other users comments.

So, what is next? I will be writing posts about the SkyFactions development journey, and how we plan to
overcome some approaching challenges. I will be summarizing some key updates for the network as a whole,
<!--more-->
including a major update coming to Survival (the Clockwork Expansion). New quests, bosses, and 3D models
are coming soon. Special thanks to Kiokugames for his extremely hard work on the expansion.

Thanks for reading, and feel free to create a Disquis account and leave a comment if you liked it :)
