# Discord  

Any server with a similar member count to ours can approach us about a partnership. We just have a few requirements:
- At least 500 members in your Discord.
- Active Minecraft server; there should at least be a few people online at all times and peaks up to 10-20.
- A somewhat active Discord server where people are interacting and posting in channels.
- Active moderation on your server. Don't allow NSFW or toxicity.
- Your Minecraft server is not cracked (promoting piracy.)
If you wish to partner with our Discord server, make a ticket or email staff@torrentsmp.com to inquire. I will do the same ping as you, for example if you ping everyone in your Discord with my ad, I will do the same for yours. Discord partnerships are nice because if people are committed to your server, they won't leave to join a random one. However it helps "share" the inactive players that may be willing to give something else a try.
If your server has less than 500 members, I have a server similar to SMP Finder called SMP Network that you can partner with. It's a server with other Minecraft servers as well as players looking for servers to play on.

# Website  

If you want to get featured on our Affiliates page, do the same for us on your website and I'll add you. The same requirements above apply. I also have a Minetrack instance. I can track your server on [there](https://track.torrentsmp.com) if you partner with us.

# Hall of Servers  

Torrent has a lobby server with some cool features, like a fishing minigame, parkour, a Hall of Fame with screenshots of our builds, and a lounge. We are also introducing a new feature called the Hall of Servers. This is where we have portals to other servers using transfer packets. Transfer packets allows a server to send a player to a different server, with a different hostname and port, without relying on a proxy server.

## Server Owners  

If you want to partner with us in this regard, there are a few things you need to do to get this done.
Build a similar "Hall of Servers" or an area at your spawn/lobby to direct players to my server. You can use an NPC, portal, command blocks, MyCommand, etc. However you feel is the best way to use this mechanic with your existing plugins is fine by me. The command is /transfer torrentsmp.com 25565 %player_name%
You will need PlaceholderAPI with the ecloud package "player" installed, as well as some plugin which can run commands as console and use those placeholders. The location of this area needs to be near your spawn, within 50 or so blocks and on the main path so players can easily find it. Don't obfuscate it.
Accept incoming transfer packets to your server. You need to be on 1.20.5+ and set `accepts-transfers=true` in server.properties. This allows you to accepts incoming connections from players that get sent from my server to yours.
Put the ad for my server in a book/lectern, hologram, signs, or some other method of display. This should be right next to or in front of the transfer mechanism. I will do the same for your server.
> NOTE: If you're on Minehut, transfers will not work as Minehut blocks transfer packets. I wish I could flex all the joins we get from Minehut everyday but that's useless here.

Contact Torrent if you would like to partner with us!
