# New Cosmetics  

I present to you, the good people of Torrent, part 1 of the cosmetic update. This includes *many* new particle effects, gadgets, chat colors, and much more! To view the cosmetics menu, use `/cosmetics`. Particle effects are cosmetic features that summon particles around your player avatar, showing off your swagger. Gadgets are items used for pranking, or just being silly and having fun. Summoning a particle effect or gadget has no in-game advantage. From the menu, there are a few **free** cosmetics you can use on all gamemodes, including the lobby:
- Particle effects
  - Snow cloud - summon a cloud of snow above your head
  - Raid cloud - I hope you're not too sad!
  - Frost lord - gain a frosty aura
  - Notes - spawn music notes above your head
  - Hearts - show your love for the server (or your friends)

# Webstore Update  

The [webstore](https://torrent.tebex.io) has had a **major update**. Along with a new, sleek theme, the webstore now supports Bedrock players! All ranks have been updated with new features, including our new cosmetics. Every player who has purchased a rank previously automatically has these new upgrades. Now, let's discuss the new cosmetics in the webstore. You'll find a new category for [cosmetics](https://torrent.tebex.io/cosmetics). From there you can purchase the full suite of emotes. Emotes are animated items that cover your face with, rather hilarious, emotes. From the navbar up above, or the `/buy` menu, you can purchase the rest of the [particle effects](https://torrent.tebex.io/particle-effects) including some really cool ones, like blood helix or enchanted. Many more [gadgets](https://torrent.tebex.io/gadgets) are available in the webstore as well, including a particle Christmas tree, exlosive sheep, and many more.

Another important feature of the new webstore is that we now support Bedrock players! If you play on Bedrock Edition, and you wish to purchase a package from our store, please input a dot (.) before your username when prompted, just like it appears in-game.

# The Next Steps  

Next, we will be working on a new resource pack for the Cosmetic Update Part 2, coinciding with the launch of Torrent [SkyFactions](https://blog.torrentsmp.com/2024/09/17/SkyFactions/). In this new update, we will be adding many more new items, without compromising the Vanilla gameplay you know and love. These new items will feature custom 3D models and textures painstakingly crafted by me and Sr. Mod - Kiokugames. The new planned items are as follows:
- Ramen noodles (courtesy of .HurricaneAlly22) - utilizes a custom recipe to make noodles, and combining those noodles with eggs, water, and mushrooms
- Quartz armor set
- Quartz toolset
- Tarnished soup - custom recipe requiring the meat from Fabricants, as well as mushrooms and a golden apple
- Chronographer armor - best armor in the game; doesn't degrade
- Chronographer tools - base on par with netherite, but can be upgraded from imperfect -> perfect to increase their power
- Obelisk (SkyFactions) - a mythical custom block that acts as the administration node for skyblock islands
- Gems - a shiny, ruby-like stone that is used as a currency for raids

We are methodically optimizing this resource pack for maximum organization and the quality of the textures/models. It is a long process but worth every second to provide quality content to you. This is all culminating in a big new update called the Survival 2.0 Expansion, with a diverse questline containing a ton of lore and amazing rewards. This questline will push the boundaries of our server a ton, and will be integrated with the new player experience seamlessly. Again, the Vanilla survival feel will be maintained as much as possible.

So, head over to the [Torrent Webstore](https://torrent.tebex.io) and check out our new cosmetics!
